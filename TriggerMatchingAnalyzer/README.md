# How to match a trigger object to a reconstructed track 

Sometimes, it is necessary to match the reconstructed object (particle) to the object that actually fired the trigger.  The triggger-level information about these objects can be retrieved using the [TriggerEvent CMSSW object](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/blob/CMSSW_5_3_X/DataFormats/HLTReco/interface/TriggerEvent.h).  In this package we show an example on how to match reconstructed tracks to objects that fired a trigger (or possible set of triggers) that contain a specific module, hltSingleJet190Regional, for this demonstration.
